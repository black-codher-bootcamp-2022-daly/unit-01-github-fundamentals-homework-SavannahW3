## What I have learnt

I have learnt the basics of github;

-How to clone repositories

-How to make a repository 

-Basic git commands 

-How git and command line/ terminal interact

## What I am still unsure about 

-I am still struggling with github/git in general but hopefully with practice this can become second nature. 

-The idea of Source control is confusing
